OGSLargeScale3D belowground competition concept. This concept returns a value between 0 and 1 for each tree added to it. Hereby, the reduction factor is calculated as the fraction of real resource uptake due to salinity dependent reduction of water uptake and the hypothetical maximal water uptake at zero salinity.
