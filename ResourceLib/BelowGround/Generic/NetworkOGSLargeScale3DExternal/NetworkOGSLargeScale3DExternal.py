# Child class of OGSLargeScale3DExternal and NetworkOGSLargeScale3D to use
# external time stepping, e.g. to run MANGA as OGS boundary condition
# The concept needs an array with cumulated cell salinity and
# the number of calls for each cell. It returns an array describing water
# withdrawal in each cell as rate in kg per sec per cell volume.
# The withdrawal is the amount of water absorbed from the soil column,
# and can be different from the amount of water available to the tree du to
# root graft mediated water exchange (see SimpleNetwork).
